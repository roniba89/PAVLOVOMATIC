# PAVLOVOMATIC
Automatic conditional behavior training machine for dogs.

We are using a static webcam near the dog to detect his position using openCV.
We use a computer with recorded commands (with the voice of the owner of the dog of course) so the computer will play the commands.
If the dog respond correctly a simple robot will release a treat for him.
Else, he won't get anything.
